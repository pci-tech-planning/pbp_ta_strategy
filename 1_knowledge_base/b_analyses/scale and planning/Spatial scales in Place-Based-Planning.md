## Spatial scales involved in planning

From [[Water Resources Planning Across Scales]].

The table below describes examples of hydrological processes that could be observed at each of the management scales. We chose these scales based on both socio-physical criteria (e.g., governance systems and hydrological processes) but also taking into account [[OWRD Administrative Basins]] and using as the minimum reference size the area of the Sandy River. 


| Spatial Level          | Extent             | Hydrological Processes                                                                                                                                                                    |
| ---------------------- | ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Focal Scale**        | < 1 km²            | Local water extraction, point-source pollution, localized runoff and infiltration                                                                                                         |
| **Local Scale**        | 1 - 1000 km²       | Runoff, Streamflow, Groundwater recharge and discharge, Water quality (temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen)                                                                                 |
| **Intermediate Scale** | 1000 - 10000 km²   | Annual precipitation, Runoff, Streamflow, Evapotranspiration, Groundwater recharge and discharge, Water quality, Natural hazard impacts (flooding, fire, drought), Climate change impacts |
| **Regional Scale**     | 10000 - 100000 km² | Basin-wide water policy, infrastructure development, Basin-wide hydrological cycle impacts, long-term precipitation patterns                                                              |
| **Statewide Scale**    | > 100000 km²       | Statewide water policies, climate change impacts, statewide water balance, climate change impacts on water availability                                                                   |
