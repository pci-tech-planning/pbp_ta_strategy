## Hydrological Processes Generating Water Supply
- Precipitation: The process that delivers water to the Earth's surface, initiating the water supply cycle.

- Infiltration: The process where water enters the soil, contributing to groundwater recharge.

- Percolation: The downward movement of water through soil layers into aquifers.

- Runoff: Water that flows over the land surface into rivers, lakes, and reservoirs.

- Evaporation: The conversion of water from liquid to vapor, returning it to the atmosphere.

- Transpiration: The release of water vapor from plants into the atmosphere.

- Condensation: The transformation of water vapor into liquid, forming clouds and eventually leading to precipitation.

- Snowmelt: The process by which snow and ice melt, contributing to surface water flow.

- Groundwater Recharge: The process by which water infiltrates and percolates down to replenish aquifers.

## Water Supply
- Surface Water Flow: Rivers, lakes, and streams that provide direct access to water for human and ecological use. This includes water drawn for municipal, agricultural, and industrial purposes.

- Groundwater: Water stored in aquifers, accessed through wells, and used for drinking water, irrigation, and other needs.

- Stored Water: Water held in reservoirs, dams, and artificial lakes, which regulates flow and provides a steady supply throughout the year.

- Desalination and Reuse: Processes like desalination of seawater and recycling of wastewater, which augment natural supplies.

- Snowpack and Glaciers: These act as natural reservoirs, slowly releasing water through snowmelt during warmer seasons.

By separating these, we can better understand how water is generated and how it is subsequently accessed and managed as a supply. This distinction also helps in water resource management, where different strategies might be needed to optimize the generation processes and the sustainable use of the supply.
