The _Colorado River Basin Climate and Hydrology: State of the Science_ report provides a comprehensive overview of the climate and hydrology of the Colorado River Basin. It examines historical data, recent trends, and future projections, providing insight into the region's hydroclimatic variability, the drivers of that variability, and the effects of human activities and climate change on water resources. The report also explores the processes that shape runoff and precipitation patterns, the critical role of snowmelt in water supply, and the ongoing challenges of water management in the face of growing demands and environmental changes.

Key findings highlight the significant role of snowmelt from the Upper Basin in driving water supply, the impact of rising temperatures on runoff timing and snowpack, and the increasing frequency of droughts. The report underscores the complexities of predicting future hydroclimatic changes due to factors such as natural variability, changing storm tracks, and the uncertainties introduced by climate change.
