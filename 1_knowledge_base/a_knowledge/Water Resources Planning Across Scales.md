#### Overall Approach and Logic Flow

The conversation started with a clarification about the concept of planning in the context of water resources management. The concept provided was: "In the context of water resources management, planning refers to the systematic process of assessing, developing, and implementing strategies to ensure the sustainable and equitable use, protection, and conservation of water resources. This involves evaluating current water usage, predicting future demands, and developing policies to balance various needs while maintaining ecological health."

We then discussed Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM) and its connection with local and regional planning. The focus was on how local and regional planning efforts align with the broader principles of IWRM to achieve sustainable water management goals.

The role of spatial scale in defining the best planning approach was explored next. We examined how the spatial scale influences assessment criteria, stakeholder engagement, policy implementation, and the effectiveness of management strategies. This led to the introduction of different spatial scales: focal, local, intermediate, regional, and statewide.

We then focused on how these spatial scales matter in the context of water resources planning in Oregon. It was noted that Oregon's administrative basins are large-scale planning units, while place-based planning (PBP) can encompass a few watersheds to an entire administrative basin.

To illustrate the concepts of grain and extent in water resources planning, we created a detailed comparison table that defines different spatial scales and their attributes, such as the level of detail (grain), geographic scope (extent), expected data resolution, key questions about water availability, and their interpretation for decision-making.

We added a layer of governance structures and hydrological processes to the table to show how different levels of governance interact with various hydrological processes and drought-related issues at each spatial scale.

Finally, we incorporated columns for example projects, budget estimates, and capacity demands to provide a comprehensive view of potential interventions at each spatial level, along with their associated costs and resource requirements.

### One Size Does Not Fit All: The Role of Spatial Scale in Water Resources Planning

#### Introduction

Water resources planning is a complex and multifaceted process that aims to ensure the sustainable and equitable management of water resources. This involves a range of activities, including assessing water availability and demand, developing policies and strategies, implementing infrastructure projects, and engaging stakeholders. The goal is to balance the various needs of different users—such as agricultural, industrial, domestic, and ecological—while protecting the health of water ecosystems and preparing for future challenges like climate change.

A critical aspect of effective water resources planning is understanding the concept of scale. In this context, "scale" refers to the geographical scope and level of detail at which planning activities are conducted. Scale can range from focal points such as specific points of diversion or use, to local areas like small watersheds or municipalities, to intermediate regions like place-based planning areas, to large areas such as administrative basins, and finally to statewide considerations. Each scale requires a different approach to data collection, stakeholder engagement, and policy development.

Understanding and addressing spatial scale is essential because it influences every aspect of the planning process. Different scales present unique challenges and opportunities. For example, large-scale planning can address broad regional issues and cumulative impacts but may overlook localized concerns. Conversely, small-scale planning can focus on detailed, site-specific issues but might miss larger regional dynamics and interactions. Intermediate scales bridge these gaps, providing a balance between detailed local assessments and broader regional strategies. By appropriately addressing spatial scale, water management strategies can be both comprehensive and context-specific, leading to more effective and sustainable outcomes.

Recognizing the importance of spatial scale allows policymakers and planners to design and implement strategies tailored to the specific needs and characteristics of different regions. This targeted approach enhances the effectiveness of policies and interventions, ensuring that resources are used efficiently and equitably. Furthermore, adopting a scale-sensitive approach enables the development of flexible and adaptive management practices, crucial for addressing the dynamic nature of water resources, particularly in the face of climate change and evolving socio-economic conditions.

#### From Focal Points to Statewide Analyses: The Role of Grain and Extent

Understanding the appropriate spatial scales for water resources planning is essential for creating effective and sustainable management strategies. Different scale levels—focal, local, intermediate, regional, and statewide—each have unique characteristics that influence how data is collected, analyzed, and used for decision-making.

At the **focal scale**, planning focuses on specific points of diversion and use, where the grain is very fine, providing detailed information about these points. The extent is very limited, covering individual points and their immediate surroundings. This level of detail is crucial for understanding the immediate availability of water for specific users, guiding individual water rights compliance and daily operations.

The **local scale** encompasses small watersheds, communities, or municipalities, where the grain remains fine but covers slightly larger areas. The extent here is limited, typically ranging from 1 to 1,000 km². Detailed, site-specific data about water availability and usage patterns within these small areas help guide local water management decisions, community planning, and infrastructure investments.

Moving to the **intermediate scale**, place-based planning areas cover multiple watersheds or sub-regions within a larger administrative basin. The grain at this scale is intermediate, combining detailed local data with broader regional information. The extent ranges from 1,000 to 10,000 km², allowing planners to assess regional water availability trends and their impacts on multiple watersheds. This helps develop regional strategies, prioritize investment areas, and ensure sustainable water use across multiple jurisdictions.

At the **regional scale**, encompassing entire administrative basins, the grain becomes coarser, with aggregated data across large regions. The extent is substantial, from 10,000 to 100,000 km². Planning at this level involves understanding the overall water balance for the basin and identifying key stressors. This informs large-scale water allocation decisions, guides policy development, and supports regional infrastructure projects.

The **statewide scale** represents the broadest extent, covering the entire state and integrating data from all regions. The grain is the coarsest, with highly aggregated data providing an overview across the state. The extent exceeds 100,000 km². Statewide analyses of water availability, distribution, long-term trends, and risks are crucial for shaping statewide water policies, allocating resources, prioritizing projects, and ensuring equitable water distribution.

To effectively manage water resources at these different scales, it is essential to understand the concepts of grain and extent. **Grain** refers to the smallest unit of observation or analysis in a spatial dataset or planning context. It indicates the level of detail or resolution at which data is collected and analyzed. Finer grain means more detailed and specific information about smaller areas, while coarser grain means less detailed information covering larger areas. For example, in a hydrological study, a fine grain might involve data collected from individual stream gauges, while a coarse grain might involve aggregated data at the watershed or basin level.

**Extent** refers to the overall spatial area covered by a study, plan, or dataset. It represents the geographic scope within which data is collected and planning activities are conducted. The extent can range from small areas like a single watershed to large areas like an entire state. For instance, the extent of a local water quality monitoring program might be limited to a single river, while the extent of a statewide water management plan would encompass all the river basins within the state.
