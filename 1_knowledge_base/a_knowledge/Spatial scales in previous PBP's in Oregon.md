#### Introduction

The analysis of place-based planning efforts in Oregon aims to understand the detailed hydrological processes, governance structures, projects, and budget estimates at various spatial scales. This comprehensive approach ensures that water resources management is effectively tailored to the specific needs and characteristics of different regions. The following methodology outlines the steps taken to analyze the Upper Grande Ronde River Watershed Plan, with the outcomes summarized in two tables: a detailed table with subbasins as rows and a summary table with spatial scale levels as rows.

#### Methodological Steps

1. **Identify the Main Basin and Its Size:**
    
    - Determine the overall area of the main basin studied.
2. **Identify Sub-basins and Their Sizes:**
    
    - List the sub-basins included in the study and their respective sizes in square kilometers.
3. **Classify Sub-basins into Spatial Scales:**
    
    - Group the main basin and sub-basins based on their sizes, according to the following criteria. 
    - Focal Scale: < 1 km²
    - Local Scale: 1 - 1,000 km²
    - Intermediate Scale: 1,000 - 10,000 km²
    - Intermediate Scale: 1,000 - 10,000 km²
    - Intermediate Scale: 1,000 - 10,000 km²
1. **Identify Hydrological Processes Studied:**
    
    - Extract and list the hydrological processes addressed in the plan for each spatial scale and basin/sub-basin
5. **Determine Governance Structures:**
    
    - Identify the governance structures involved in the management of the watersheds at each spatial scale.
6. **List Projects and Budget Estimates:**
    
    - List the projects/actions included in the plan for the corresponding spatial levels basin/sub-basins as well as the projected budgets for each project
    
7. **Summarize in a Table:**
    
    - Create a detailed table that includes:
        - Spatial Scale (Focal, Local, Intermediate...)
        - Basin and sub-basin names and sizes within each category
        - Hydrological Processes
        - Governance Structures
        - Projects
        - Budget Estimates
8. **Consolidate Information by Spatial Scale:**
    
    - Combine the information from the basin and sub-basins into a consolidated table with rows corresponding to each spatial scale and providing the range for budgets costs across the spatial levels.
