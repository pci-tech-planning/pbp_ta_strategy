#### Introduction

The analysis of place-based planning efforts in Oregon aims to understand the detailed hydrological processes, governance structures, projects, and budget estimates at various spatial scales. This comprehensive approach ensures that water resources management is effectively tailored to the specific needs and characteristics of different regions. The following methodology outlines the steps taken to analyze the Upper Grande Ronde River Watershed Plan, with the outcomes summarized in two tables: a detailed table with subbasins as rows and a summary table with spatial scale levels as rows.

#### Methodological Steps

1. **Identify the Main Basin and Its Size:**
    
    - Determine the overall area of the main basin studied.
2. **Identify Sub-basins and Their Sizes:**
    
    - List the sub-basins included in the study and their respective sizes in square kilometers.
3. **Classify Sub-basins into Spatial Scales:**
    
    - Group the sub-basins into local and intermediate scales based on their sizes.
    - Focal Scale: < 1 km²
    - Local Scale: 1 - 1,000 km²
    - Intermediate Scale: 1,000 - 10,000 km²
    - Intermediate Scale: 1,000 - 10,000 km²
    - Intermediate Scale: 1,000 - 10,000 km²
1. **Identify Hydrological Processes Studied:**
    
    - Extract and list the hydrological processes addressed in the plan for each spatial scale.
5. **Determine Governance Structures:**
    
    - Identify the governance structures involved in the management of the watersheds at each spatial scale.
6. **List Projects and Budget Estimates:**
    
    - List the projects formulated to address the hydrological processes at each spatial scale.
    - Provide rough budget estimates for these projects.
7. **Summarize in a Table:**
    
    - Create a detailed table that includes:
        - Spatial Scale
        - Subwatershed Names and Sizes
        - Hydrological Processes
        - Governance Structures
        - Projects
        - Budget Estimates
8. **Consolidate Information by Spatial Scale:**
    
    - Combine the information from the subwatersheds into a consolidated view for each spatial scale.
